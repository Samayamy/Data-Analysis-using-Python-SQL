# Data-Analysis-using-Python-SQL

This project showcases a comprehensive data analytics workflow, leveraging Python and SQL to derive actionable insights from a sales dataset. By utilizing the Kaggle API, I downloaded the dataset and performed extensive data processing and cleaning using pandas. The cleaned data was then loaded into an SQL Server for robust querying and analysis.

#Key Steps:
#Dataset Acquisition:

Used the Kaggle API to download the sales dataset, ensuring efficient and reproducible data access.
Data Processing and Cleaning:

Employed pandas for data wrangling, handling missing values, and normalizing data formats.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and identify outliers.
Loading Data into SQL Server:

Established a connection to SQL Server and created relevant tables.
Loaded the cleaned dataset into SQL Server, ensuring data integrity and optimal schema design.
SQL Querying and Analysis:

Executed complex SQL queries to answer key business questions, such as:
Find top 10 highest revenue-generating products
Find top 5 highest selling products in each region
Find month-over-month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023 sales (e.g., Jan 2022 vs Jan 2023)
Determine which month had the highest sales for each category
Identify the sub-category with the highest growth by profit in 2023 compared to 2022
Highlights:
Data Cleaning: Ensured the dataset was free from inconsistencies, duplicates, and irrelevant data points, leading to more accurate analysis.
SQL Integration: Leveraged SQL's powerful querying capabilities to derive insights, perform aggregations, and join multiple tables.
Reproducibility: Utilized Jupyter notebooks and SQL scripts to document the entire process, making it easy to reproduce and understand the analysis steps.
Conclusion:
This project exemplifies the integration of Python and SQL for data analytics, demonstrating the end-to-end workflow from data acquisition to insightful analysis. The insights generated provide valuable information for strategic decision-making, highlighting the importance of a robust data processing pipeline.
